# NEWS but from Aesop Rock

## Overview
This project is me trying out and experimenting with **AgentStack**. It takes **five recent news headlines** and fuses them into a single, intricate rap verse styled after **Aesop Rock**.

(PS: Not that I'm a big Aesop Rock fan, as a matter of fact I can't even name five Aesop songs. It was just the first name I thought of)

## How It Works
1. The **newsresearcher** agent collects the **five latest news headlines** from online sources.  
2. The **aesoprock** agent analyzes these headlines and crafts a unified 5-7 line rap verse, blending all the headlines into one creative narrative.  
3. The output is an entertaining, lyrical summary of the day's top stories.
