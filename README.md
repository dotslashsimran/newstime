# NEWS but from Aesop Rock

## Overview
This project is me experimenting with **AgentStack** by building two AI-powered agents that collaborate to deliver a lyrical twist on current events. It takes **five recent news headlines** and fuses them into a single, intricate rap verse styled after **Aesop Rock**.

(PS: Not that I'm a big Aesop Rock fan, as a matter of fact I can't even name five Aesop songs. It was just the first name I thought of)

### Agents:
1. **newsresearcher**  
   - Fetches the **five latest news headlines** from the internet using APIs.  

2. **aesoprock**  
   - Converts these headlines into a **single, cohesive rap verse** inspired by the dense, abstract lyricism of Aesop Rock.  

## How It Works
1. The **newsresearcher** agent collects the **five latest news headlines** from online sources (e.g., NewsAPI).  
2. The **aesoprock** agent analyzes these headlines and crafts a unified 5-7 line rap verse, blending all the headlines into one creative narrative.  
3. The output is an entertaining, lyrical summary of the day's top stories.
